setInterval vs setTimeout

setInterval is setTimeout for multiple times. It also ensures proper time durations between events.

browsers will throttle setInterval for inactive tabs.

apply is like call but takes an array

fn.call(thisobj,args)

in javascript the {} datatype is always passed by ref.
